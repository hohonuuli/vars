## Definitions and Descriptions
__?__ (annotation button) - Used to indicate the identity of some object is uncertain.

__Annotation Mode__ (found on the bottom left of the main window) - Select the mode: _Outline_ or _Detail_  
_Outline_ annotations include animals discernable at approximately 2x real-time tape speed. The level (species, genus, family, etc.) and certainty of identification depends on current knowledge of deep-sea organisms and physical factors, such as ROV speed, camera setting, or visibility. Outline annotation also includes characterization of major habitats, such as seep or canyon wall, and geological features such as rock outcrop, sand, or fault. The characterization is usually annotated at a regular intervals (approximately five minutes), at identification of samples and equipment, and at the start and end of transects.  
_Detailed_ annotations include all discernable organisms, behaviors, and habitats possible at real-time speed.

title: VARS Query Application
---

The VARS Query allows easy access to information from a video annotation database. Complex queries can be made by constraining temporal, spatial, or physical parameters (for example: season, location, or depth). The VARS Query references the knowledgebase (described above). Using the query tool, users can identify the location of video sequences or access other information recorded during ROV research dives.

The VARS applications use Google Guice for dependency injection. If you 
write your own implementations, instead of using the vars-jpa module then 
you will need to bind the following interfaces to their implementations:
    AnnotationDAOFactory
    AnnotationFactory
    AnnotationPersistenceService
    ExternalDataPersistenceService
    KnowledgebaseDAOFactory
    KnowledgebaseFactory
    KnowledgebasePersistenceService
    MiscDAOFactory
    MiscFactory
    PersistenceCacheProvider
    QueryPersistenceService
    VarsUserPreferencesFactory
    PreferencesFactory

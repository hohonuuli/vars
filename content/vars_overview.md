The Video Annotation and Reference System (VARS), consisting of software and hardware, was developed to facilitate the creation, storage, and retrieval of video annotation records from the ROV dive tapes.

As shown in the figure below, video is initially recorded by cameras. At MBARI, we collect video using ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). This video can then be archived on tape or in video files. Using the Annotation application, users can take frame grabs and enter annotations of interesting events and observations seen on the video. Annotations are constrained by terms and description templates stored in a knowledge database. If needed, users can edit the contents of the knowledge database using the Knowledgebase application. At any point, users can search for and retrieve annotations through the Query application.

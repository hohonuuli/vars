INSTALLING VARS ON MAC OS X    
    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~  Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using VARS to annotate video tapes be aware that Apple computers do 
not ship with built in serial ports. In order to fully use the Annotation 
application you will need to install a serial port in order to talk to the VCR. 
Their are several options for this, the easiest is using a USB Serial Port 
adapter such as the USB PDA/Serial Adapter (GUC232A) from IOGEAR. Be sure to 
install the correct driver too! Some video capture cards include an RS422 serial
port that can be used by VARS.

NOTE: The serial port libraries included with VARS  work on Snow Leopard (Mac
OS X 10.6). If you need to run on Leopard you should contact Brian Schlining

~~  Running VARS for the first time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'Out-of-the-box', VARS is configured to run against a bundled database server. 
This server is suitable for testing and small deployments. Other than installing 
the prerequisites, no configuration is necessary to start VARS.

When you are ready to run VARS for the first time, start the Knowledgebase 
application (using varsKb or knowledgebase). This will prompt you to create an 
administrator account for controlling modifications to the VARS knowledgebase.

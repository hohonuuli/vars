title: MBARI's Video Annotation and Reference System
---

The Video Annotation and Reference System (VARS) is a suite of tools developed by the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](http://www.mbari.org) for describing, cataloging, retrieving, and viewing the visual, descriptive, and quantitative data associated with video.

Originally designed for annotating underwater video, VARS can be applied to any video dataset that requires constrained, searchable annotations.

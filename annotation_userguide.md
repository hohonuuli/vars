This guide provides basic instructions for starting and using the VARS Annotation application. Useful definitions can be found in the [glossary](glossary.html)

## Set-up and Getting Started

- If you are working with __video tapes__, please read the instructions in this [README](https://github.com/hohonuuli/vars/tree/master/vars-standalone/src/main/assembly/files) file.
- If you are annotating __video files__, follow the setup instruction in this [README](https://github.com/hohonuuli/vars/tree/videofile-jdk8/vars-standalone/src/main/assembly/files) file.

## Logging In

1. To annotate in VARS you will need a VARS user account. If this is the very first time that VARS is being launched on a new database, you will need to create an admin account. Please see the [Knowledgebase User Guide](knowledgebase_userguide.html) for instruction on creating an admin account. If you just need to create a non-admin user account, do the following:

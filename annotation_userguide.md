title: VARS Annotation User Guide
---

This guide provides basic instructions for starting and using the VARS Annotation application. Useful definitions can be found in the [glossary](glossary.html)

## Set-up and Getting Started

- If you are working with __video tapes__, please read the instructions in this [README](https://github.com/hohonuuli/vars/tree/master/vars-standalone/src/main/assembly/files) file.
- If you are annotating __video files__, follow the setup instruction in this [README](https://github.com/hohonuuli/vars/tree/videofile-jdk8/vars-standalone/src/main/assembly/files) file.

## Logging in and Opening a Video

1. __Login to VARS__. To annotate in VARS you will need a VARS user account. If this is the very first time that VARS is being launched on a new database, you will need to create an admin account. Please see the [Knowledgebase User Guide](knowledgebase_userguide.html) for instruction on creating an admin account. If you just need to create a non-admin user account, do the following:
    1. Click on __User:__ on the toolbar. [<img width="100" src="images/annotation_app2.png">](images/annotation_app2.png)
    2. In the login dialog that appears, click on _Create a new user account_. [<img width="100" src="images/annotation_app_userlogin2.png">](images/annotation_app_userlogin2.png)
2. __Open a movie file__.  
    1. Click on the __Video:__ on the toolbar[<img width="100" src="images/annotation_app3.png">](images/annotation_app3.png)
    2. In the movie dialog that appears, you can choose to browse to a new movie or open one that had previously been annotated.
        - To browse to a new movie, select the _Open by Location_ check box. Then browse to or enter a URL to a movie. You __must__ also select a _camera platform_ and enter a _sequence number_.
        - To open a previously annotated move, select the _Open Existing_ checkbox. Then select the name of the file you'd like to annotated.

## Video Controls
The interface includes a VCR control panel. This panel was designed for use with VCR's but works _mostly_ as expected with video files.

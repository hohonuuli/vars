About DAO: 
	As currently implemented. The makePersistent/makeTransient/update/findByPrimaryKey methods
are exactly the same for all the DAO's so any DAO will work with any Entity object. However,
each DAO implements some methods that are specific for a particular entity. Usually, these
methods are query methods. 


Working with the Concepts:

To insert into the database:
	NOTE: inserts cascade. Inserting a concept will insert all it's children.
  Example:
	// Assume you've already created a concept here
	IConcept concept; 
	// ---- Step 1: You need to make sure you're working with a persisted parent concept!!
	IConcept parentConcept = dao.findByName('something') 
	// ---- Step 2: Add Concept to parent
	parentConcept.addChildConcept(concept);
	// ---- Step 3: insert
	dao.makePersistent(concept) // OR dao.update(parentConcept)
		
To delete from the database:
	NOTE: Deletes cascade to the childConcepts but NOT to the parent.
  Example:
	// ---- Step 1: Detach from the parent
	concept.getParentConcept().removeChildConcept(concept);
	// ---- Step 2: Execute delete
	dao.makeTransient(concept);
